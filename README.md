Age-Based Car Rental Analysis 📊

This project explores car rental trends by analyzing age-based preferences, identifying the most rented car models, and understanding the rental behavior of different age groups. The analysis is conducted using simulated data, ensuring that no real individuals or actual data are involved.

--------------------------------------

Overview 🧾
The project focuses on answering these key questions:

  1. Which car models are most preferred by each age group?
  2. Which age group rents cars most frequently?
  3. What is the overall most rented car model?
  4. Which professions prefer specific car models the most?

--------------------------------------

Dataset Description 📂
The dataset includes the following simulated fields:

 *Age: The customer's age.
 *Age Group: Categorized age ranges (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, etc.).
 *Rented Car: The car model rented (e.g., Volkswagen Golf, Fiat Doblo, Renault Kadjar).
 *Occupation: The customer's profession (e.g., Engineer, Teacher).
 *Amount Paid: Rental payment amount (randomly simulated values).
 *Distance Travelled: Distance driven in kilometers (simulated).
 
--------------------------------------

Disclaimer ⚠️

The dataset used in this analysis is entirely simulated for educational and analytical purposes only. It does not represent any real individuals, businesses, or transactions.

Key Findings 🔍

 1.Most Active Age Group

  * The age group 25-34 emerged as the most active group in renting cars.
  * This group frequently rents Toyota Corolla, making it their top choice.
    
 2.Most Preferred Car by Age Groups

  * 18-25: Volkswagen Golf is the most popular choice
  * 26-35: Volkswagen Golf dominate this group's preference.
  * 36-46: Volkswagen Golf is the most popular choice
  * 46-55: Volkswagen Golf is the primary choice.
  * 56-65: Renault Megane and Volkswagen Golf see the highest preference.
  * 65+: Volkswagen Golf is the primary choice.
   
 3.Overall Most Rented Car

  * Across all age groups, Volkswagen Golf is the most rented car.

 4.Occupational Preferences

  * Engineers prefer Toyota Corolla the most.
  * Teachers rent Ford Fiesta more frequently.
  * Doctors lean towards Volkswagen Golf.

Steps Performed 🛠️

 1. Data Cleaning
    
  *Handled missing values and ensured consistent data formatting.
  *Grouped age ranges into specific categories for better analysis.

 2. Age Group Analysis
    
  *Categorized customers into age groups (e.g., 18-24, 25-34).
  *Calculated rental counts for each group and identified their top car model.

 3. Visualization
    
  *Created bar plots and count plots to visualize:
  *Rental preferences by age group.
  *Distribution of car rentals across age groups.
  *Most rented car model overall.

 4. Insights Extraction
    
  *Identified the age group renting the most and their preferred car.
  *Highlighted the overall most rented car.
  *Analyzed professions and their car rental preferences.
